In this project I have implemented a single page website using React JS and Bootstrap framework.
It includes total 4 sections:
1. Header: Webpage name

2. Main: Includes 3 blog posts with a heading, image and summary. When you will click on the heading, it will display the whole blog post.

3. Aside: Uses Google API to display top 5 trending news and this section refreshes every 5 seconds using AJAX calls. It also includes a Home button to redirect ot the homepage whenever reqired. You can also click on the new links to open the news in a new tab.

4. Footer: Copyright related info

To run this project first download this package.
Unzip it and open tne command promt.
Go to tihs directory and give the following commands:

npm install

npm start

This will open the webpage.
